# ðŸ‘‰ Day 27 Challenge

Welcome to your first video game creation. You will create a video game that creates a character's health and attack stats...along with an epic name for your character.

Do not delete today's code. You will be building upon it on Day 28.

- Write a subroutine that generates a character: first name and character type (human, imp, wizard, elf, etc.).
- Write a subroutine that multiplies a bunch of random dice rolls together to generate the character's health stats. Use this formula:

- Write a second subroutine that multiplies a bunch of random dice rolls together to generate the character's strength stats. Use this formula:

- Present the data in a menu with time.sleep and os.system("clear") to make it appealing.
- Wrap it in a loop so the user has the option to create another character.
  Example:

```
Character Builder
Name Your Legend:
Sheila the Almighty
Character Type (Human, Elf, Wiard, Orc):
Human
Sheila the Almighty
HEALTH: 40
STRENGTH: 26
May your name go down in Legend...
```
