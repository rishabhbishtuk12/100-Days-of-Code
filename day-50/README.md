# ðŸ‘‰ Day 50 Challenge

Day 50! Boy, you are smashing this 100 days! ðŸŽŠ To celebrate, here's a project for you.

Your idea storage system should:

1. Prompt the user to add an idea, or load a random one.
2. Choosing 'Add an idea' results in:
   - A prompt for the user to input their idea.
   - Add the idea to a text file called 'my.ideas'.
   - Add the idea in append mode, with every new idea on a brand new line.
3. Choosing 'Load random' results in: - Load the list of ideas. - Choose one at random. - Display it on screen for a few seconds. - Return to the menu.

Example:

```

Add an idea or see a random idea? a/r. > r

Input your idea. > Youth hostelling with Chris Eubank

```
