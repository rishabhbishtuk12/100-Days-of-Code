# os Library

## What is the os library?

It allows us to "talk" to the console. One of the most powerful things we can do with this library is allow it to clear the console.

## Import the os library

ðŸ‘‰ Well, this just prints a list of numbers to 1,000...

```py
import os
for i in range(1,1000):
print(i)
```

## Adding os.system

We can clear the code above by using the `os.system` function to 'clear' the console.

ðŸ‘‰ Add this to the code above: (remember to indent this properly)

```py
os.system("clear")
```

Do you notice how it clears the console? Cool, right?!

## Let's try one more...

ðŸ‘‰ For this code, I want the program to say "Welcome to Replit!", delete that, and then ask for my username on a blank screen. Remove the previous code, add the code below and see what happens when you hit run!

```py
import os
print("Welcome")
print("to")
print("Replit")
os.system("clear")
username = input("Username: ")
```

Wow! The console printed and cleared 'Welcome to Replit!' before I even had a chance to read it.

# Time Library

We can import a second library by placing a , after the name of the first library.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's add a second library, time.

```py
import os, time
```

This library allows us to pause the execution of a program for a specific amount of time.

The `time.sleep(1)` function allows us to pause the program for the amount of seconds listed in the `()`.

ðŸ‘‰ Add this to your code before the program is cleared to pause the program for 1 second before displaying the username.

```py
time.sleep(1)
os.system("clear")
```
