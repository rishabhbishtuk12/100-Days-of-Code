# ðŸ‘‰ Day 57 Challenge

Try to use recursion to build a factorial program.

Yep, it's a math challenge. Recursion is often good for this type of problem.

It could be a real head scratcher, so don't be afraid to use 100 Days of Code Community or the Discord channel for help.

A factorial is the product of all the numbers up to a value, starting from 1.

For example, factorial 5 would be 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 5 = 120

1. Write a function that:
   - Starts at the highest number.
   - Multiplies that by factorial of itself minus one
   - Terminates when it reaches 1 and returns 1
   - Outputs the factorial.

Example:

```
ðŸŒŸFactorial FinderðŸŒŸ
Input a number > 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.
What Is Recursion?
Before we start, go Google 'recursion'.

Those cats at Google are hilarious, aren't they?

ðŸ‘‰ Recursion is a type of program where you get a subroutine to call itself. It gets kinda hard to explain. I'd very much recommend this book, which does an excellent job of explaining this concept.

Recursion lets us solve problems in a more human way. Some mathematical problems can just be solved better using recursion.

For example:

We want to print out a sequence of the same emoji, reducing by 2 emojis per line. (eg print a row of 9, then a row of 7, then 5, etc. until we get none).

We will end up with a reverse pyramid pattern.

We could use `range()`, but it's a bit odd with counting backwards. Or a loop, but that would be pretty long.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's an example of a recursive solution.

```py
def reverse(value):
if value <= 0:
print("Done!")
return

# This `if` provides the 'stop' condition for the program. Otherwise it would run forever.

else: # if we're not at the stop condition.
for i in range(value):
print("ðŸ’¯", end="") # Outputs 'value' emojis
print() # New line
reverse(value - 2) # takes 2 off the value and calls the subroutine again with this new number. Eg if value was 7 it would call 'reverse(value)' again with value as 5.
reverse(5)
```

Try calling this with 10 as the argument. Did you get this output?
