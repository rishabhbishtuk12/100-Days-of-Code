## Print Statements

```py
print("Hello Replit")
```

- The "" (quotes) are used to tell the command that you're putting text in there (any text you want)
- A bunch of text (or whatever you put in quotes) is called a string.

## Multiple Print Statements

Use the triple quote """ if you want to write a big chunk of text with gaps or line breaks. Add this code to what you have in main.py and hit run.

print("""Anything that starts
with three quotes, and ends
in three quotes can span
many lines and even contain " symbols
within it without freaking anything out!""")

## Common Errors

### NameError

You'll see this error message if:
you get the name of a function wrong
you misspell it
get the capitalization wrong

### SyntaxError

You will see this message if:
you have the order of the symbols wrong
you forget () or " "

## Fix this code

```py
print(= MUSIC+ =)
print("> Songs"
Print("> Albums")
print(> Artists")
```

Answer:

```py
print("= MUSIC+ =")
print("> Songs")
print("> Albums")
print("> Artists")
```

## Project - 1 : Print into the World

- Write your full name and today's date in separate lines of code.
- Copy this text below. See if you can do it with just the one print statement!

```txt
I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happend to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
```

- On the next line add I am feeling with an emoji of your choice to illustrate how you're feeling about the challenge.

- Add one more line to your output You can follow my progress at replit.com/@ and add in your Replit username. This will be a great way of maintaining accountability for yourself!

- Run your program.
