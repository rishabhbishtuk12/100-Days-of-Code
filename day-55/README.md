# ðŸ‘‰ Day 55 Challenge

Back the 'f' up everybody!

'f' is short for 'file', of course. What did you think I meant?

Get your minds out of the gutter, go back and get your auto save/load to do list from Day 51 and use it here.

Your program should:

1. Create a backup folder.
2. Create a random filename.
3. Save a copy of the data to that file.
4. This should all happen before the auto save.

# The os Library

Today's lesson is going to use the os library to create folders and navigate around them.

Previously, we've used os to clear the screen.

Here are a few other things that it can do:

## List a file

ðŸ‘‰ `listdir()` will allow you to list all the files:

```py
import os
print(os.listdir()) # Lists all the files in the current directory. Useful for checking that a file is in the folder we think it is.
files = os.listdir()
if "quickSave.txt" not in files:
print("Error: Quick Save not found.")
#Checks if a file is in a directory and outputs an error if not.
```

## Create a folder

ðŸ‘‰ Try this code with `os.mkdir()`:

```py
import os
os.mkdir("Hello") # Creates a folder called 'Hello'
```

## Renames a file

ðŸ‘‰ `os.rename()` takes 2 arguments: the file to rename and the new name.

```py
import os
os.rename("myname.txt", "NEW.o")
```

Hint: You would need a file called "myname.txt" already uploaded to the file tree in order to change the file name.

The ability to create and manage files & folders is really useful, especially for backups.
