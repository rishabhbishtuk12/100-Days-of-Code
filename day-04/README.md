# Day 4 Challenge

1. Ask your users to list a bunch of information about them: things they like, things they hate, names of family and friends... it's up to you how many and what kinds of things you pick. Keep it wacky!
2. Now construct your story - it can be about anything you want, but must use the variables you've created in step 1.
3. Make sure to only work one paragraph at a time. Otherwise things could get a bit messy.
