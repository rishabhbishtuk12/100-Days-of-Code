# Dictionaries

As you might have guessed, we love lists. However, list items are accessed in order by index number. This isn't always the way we want it to work.

Dictionaries are a slightly different type of list that access data by giving each item a key. This creates what we call key:value pairs.

Now we can access each item through its key, instead of having to remember what index it is at in the list.

## Creating a dictionary - brace!

Curly, curly braces...

To create a dictionary we start just like a list, except with curly braces {}. This dictionary will store data about a user.

The data is inserted in key value pairs like this. Each pair is separated by a comma:

ðŸ‘‰ The first key:value pair below has "name" as the key and "David" as the value. Try it out:

```py
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}
```

## Printing the keys

To output (print) from a dictionary, we can use the key instead of the index. Note that we still use square brackets for accessing items (ex: ["name"]).

ðŸ‘‰ Let's print "name".

```py
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}
print(myUser["name"])

# This code outputs 'David'.
```

## Changing an item

You can use the = syntax to change key values.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's change 'David' to 'The legendary David'

```py
myUser = {"name": "David", "age": 128}
myUser["name"] = "The legendary David"
print(myUser)
# This code outputs 'name:'the legendary David', 'age':'128.
```

# ðŸ‘‰ Day 40 Challenge

Today's challenge is to create a contact card using a dictionary.

Ask the user to input their name, date of birth, telephone number, email and physical address.
Store it all in a dictionary.
Print it out in a nice way once its stored.
Example:

```
ðŸŒŸContact CardðŸŒŸ
Input your name > David Morgan
Input your date of birth > 01/01/1900
Input your telephone number > 01234 567890
Input your email > david@replit.com
Input your address > The Cupboard Under The Stairs, Replit Towers, NY.
Hi David Morgan. Our dictionary says that you were born on 01/01/1900, we can call you on 01234 567890, email david@replit.com, or write to The Cupboard Under The Stairs, Replit Towers, NY.
