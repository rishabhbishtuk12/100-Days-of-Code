# ðŸ‘‰ Day 42 Challenge

"Some trainers have no fear. To them, this is just one more challenge".

- Create a dictionary to store the details of your, ahem, MokÃ©Beast.
- Ask the user to input the following details: name, type (earth, fire, air, water or spirit), special move, starting HP and starting MP. For now we're just taking in one set of values for one beast.
- Output the beast's details.
- Check the beast's type and change the color of the text accordingly. Fire is red, water is blue, air is white. You decide on the others.

ðŸ¥³ Extra points for getting all the `inputs` with just one input command and the `split` function.

ðŸ‘‰ IMPORTANT INFO - keep a note of where this Repl is, you'll need it in a couple of lessons' time.

Example:

```
ðŸ‘¾ MokÃ©Beast - The Non-Copyright Generic Beast Battle Game ðŸ‘¾
Input your beast's name > Brian
Input your beast's type > Earth
Input your beast's special move > Flying bellyflop
Input your beast's staring HP > 50
Input your beast's staring MP > 20

# This text outputs in green

Your beast is called Brian. It is an earth beast with a special move of Flying bellyflop
```

# Gotta Catch 'Em All....

And Put Them In A Dictionary
This challenge is all about using dictionaries to create a game about small creatures that you have captured, enslaved, and forced to fight for your amusement. You monster.

This game works in a completely non-copyright and totally lawyer friendly way. Pika-who? I have absolutely no idea what you mean..... officer.
