# Subroutine
So far, when we wanted to repeat code, we have had to use loops or copy and paste code.

What if I told you there was a way to use code or call it and use it anytime anywhere??

That is a subroutine!!

A subroutine tells the computer that a piece of code exists and to go run that code again and again...

### Just like a recipe
Subroutines work like a recipe in a cookbook. If you want to know how to make a cake, you don't have to start from scratch every time. You can use a recipe to get the same quality each time.

### How do we define a subroutine?
A subroutine is defined by:
```
def (which stands for definition)
```
You need to give the subroutine a name (and just like with a variable, you can't have spaces).

You need to add () even if there are no arguments followed by a colon :. The code needs to be indented.

Create a subroutine with both a username and password.
Create a loop to prompt the user again and again until they put in the correct login information.
```
Login System
What is your username?: rishabh
What is your password? 12
Whoops! I don't recognize that username or password. Try again!
What is your username? rishabh
What is your password? 123
Welcome !
