ðŸ‘‰ Day 31 Challenge

- Create a classic user interface using string manipulation.

- Create these two user interfaces (below) using everything you know about extensions to `print` statements and f-strings.

- The second one is a bit more tricky as it involves alignment.

- There are no input statements. This is all about using `print` and variables in interesting ways. However, you may want to create a subroutine to make the color changing easier (like you did on Day 29).
