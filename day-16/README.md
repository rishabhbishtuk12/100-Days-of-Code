# while True Loop
On Day 15, you learned how to create a while loop. However, there are a lot of moving parts that can turn the while loop into an accidental infinite loop...and a nightmare.

## Introducing the while True loop...

ðŸ‘‰Let's try it out.
What do you think the below code does?

Remember you can use the big Stop button on the top if your program does not end.
```py
while True:
  print("This program is running")
print("Aww, I was having a good time ðŸ˜­")
```
#### This type of loop only has two conditions: True and False. Make note of the capital "T" and "F".

In this loop, I am saying to the computer:

"while True is True...do this over and over again."

Yes, we made an infinite loop, but hold on...
