# ðŸ‘‰ Day 30 Challenge

Create a program that uses a loop that asks the user what they have thought of each of the 30 days of challenges so far.

For each day, prompt the user to answer a question and restate it in a full sentence that is center aligned underneath the heading.

Example:

```
30 Days Down
Day 1:
Amazing
You thought Day 1 was amazing.
Day 2:
so good that I bought the David plushie
You thought Day 2 was so good...
```

# f-strings

f-strings (format strings) are the best way to combine variables and text together. Everything up until now has been...well...awkward.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's look at how we have combined variables and text in the past...concatenating.

```py
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"

print("This is", name, "using", pronouns, "pronouns and is age", age)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Let's now use an f-string for this same code. What changes did I make to this code?

```py
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"
print("This is {}, using {} pronouns, and is {} years old.".format(name, pronouns, age))
```

Change 1: Using `{}` as a placeholder for the variable. Change 2: Adding `.format(variable names, commas)`

# Local Variables

We can set local variables within the f-string itself. Now it doesn't matter the order of the variables.

ðŸ‘‰ Looking at this code again, I can set my variables inside the text itself. Watch this:

```py
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"
print("This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age))
```

Change 1: Replace `{}`with variable names. Change 2: Replace each variable inside `{}` with what has been defined in `format.( = )`

f-strings work with different variable types too: `int`, `float`, and `string`.

ðŸ‘‰ We can assign concatenated sentences to variables. Watch this. We made a variable called response and made it equal to a concatenated sentence. Now I can use this response easily wherever I want.

```py
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"
response = "This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far".format(name=name, pronouns=pronouns, age=age)
print(response)
```

# The Power of f...

Instead of all that faffing about...try this instead.

Use the letter `f` before any string with `{}` for variable names (and forget that `.format` business).

ðŸ‘‰ Look at this same code and see the difference using this technique:

```py
name = "Katie"
age = "28"
pronouns = "she/her"
response = f"This is {name}, using {pronouns} pronouns, and is {age} years old. Hello, {name}. How are you? Have you been having a great {age} years so far"
print(response)
```

# Alignment

![alt text](image-3.png)
left = `<`, right = `>`, center = `^`

ðŸ‘‰ This program shows how much of 100 Days of Code we have completed so far. I want this to look like a list. However, once we get to day 10, it starts to look a bit messy. Make sure you include `f` when using alignment.

```py
for i in range(1, 31):
print(f"Day {i} of 30")
```

ðŸ‘‰ Let's fix it by adding a left alignment of 2 characters long.

```py
for i in range(1, 31):
print(f"Day {i: <2} of 30")
```
